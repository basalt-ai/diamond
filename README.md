## The Evaluation Dataset Crisis

Every AI team hits the same wall: **flaky datasets make bad Evals.**

Your datasets are full of poorly defined expected outputs (if any) and rarely made by domain experts. Random samples from production logs with no strategy behind what actually gets included. Zero visibility into what scenarios you're missing. Millions of valuable interactions sitting unused because no one knows which ones actually matter.

**The painful reality:** You're making critical AI decisions based on datasets that don't represent your users, don't cover your edge cases, and drift away from reality over time.

Your evals are only as good as your datasets, this is the hard part.

## Why Status Quo Fails

**Manual curation doesn't scale.** Your dataset should constantly evolve with new scenarios, or you risk overfitting your AI on a fixed number of scenarios.

**Random sampling misses what matters.** Most production logs are routine — the interesting edge cases that break your AI get lost in the noise.

**No systematic coverage.** You have 1,000 examples but zero insight into what user scenarios you're actually testing.

**Ground truth chaos.** Three reviewers, three different "correct" answers. Your dataset quality depends on who had coffee that morning.
